# Uncertainty Hub - Flow Logic Documentation

## Overview
The Uncertainty Hub (`pages/01_Uncertainty_Hub.py`) is a comprehensive, progressive tutorial system for teaching error analysis and uncertainty concepts in physics lab settings. It implements a structured learning path with conditional access control, progress tracking, and adaptive content delivery.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Main Hub (`01_Uncertainty_Hub.py`)
- **Entry Point**: Central controller that manages the entire tutorial experience
- **Page Configuration**: Wide layout, expanded sidebar, Â± icon
- **Session Management**: Handles user authentication and progress state

#### 2. Trial Tracker (`lib/trial_tracker.py`)
- **Progress Engine**: Manages student progress through sections and questions
- **Access Control**: Enforces sequential section completion
- **Data Persistence**: Tracks attempts, responses, and completion status
- **Export Functionality**: Provides CSV export for instructors (password protected)

#### 3. Section Modules (`pages/uncertainty_sections/`)
- **Modular Content**: Each section is a separate Python module
- **Conditional Rendering**: Content visibility depends on progress
- **Question Sequences**: Structured learning with progressive difficulty

## Flow Logic

### 1. Initialization & Authentication
```
User visits page â†’ Email collection â†’ Validation (@hamilton.edu) â†’ Session initialization
```

**Key Features:**
- **Email Gate**: Must provide valid Hamilton College email to proceed
- **Session State**: Initializes trial tracker and progress tracking
- **Persistent State**: Progress maintained across page refreshes

### 2. Progress Tracking System

#### Section Access Control
```python
sections = [
    "intro", "precision_accuracy", "uncertainty_range", 
    "one_measurement", "range_method", "std_dev_gaussian", "standard_form"
]
```

**Access Rules:**
- **First Section**: Always accessible
- **Subsequent Sections**: Require completion of final question in previous section
- **Question Sequences**: Within each section, questions must be completed sequentially

#### Progress Calculation
```python
progress = {
    "total_sections": 7,
    "completed_sections": count,
    "progress_percentage": (completed / total) * 100,
    "next_section": next_unlocked_section
}
```

### 3. Navigation & UI

#### Tab System
- **Custom Styling**: Tabs look like traditional browser tabs
- **State Management**: Active tab stored in session state
- **Visual Feedback**: 
  - Active: Blue border, highlighted
  - Accessible: Clickable, normal appearance
  - Locked: Grayed out with ðŸ”’ icon

#### Navigation Controls
- **Section Navigation**: "Next Section" button (only if accessible)
- **Scroll Management**: Automatic scroll-to-top on tab changes
- **Anchor System**: Reliable scrolling using HTML anchors

### 4. Content Delivery

#### Section Rendering
```python
def render_section_with_nav(section_index, render_callable):
    # Render section content
    render_callable()
    
    # Add navigation buttons
    # Back to Top, Next Section (if accessible)
```

#### Conditional Content
- **Question Visibility**: Based on completion of previous questions
- **Text Content**: Shows after required questions are completed
- **Optional Questions**: Always visible, don't block progress

### 5. Question System

#### Question Types
1. **Required Questions**: Must be completed to unlock next content
2. **Optional Questions**: Always accessible, for feedback/interest
3. **Final Questions**: Mark sections as complete when answered correctly

#### Answer Tracking
```python
def record_attempt(question_id, is_correct, answer_given, section_name):
    # Track attempts, correct/incorrect counts
    # Mark questions as complete
    # Mark sections as complete if final question
```

### 6. Data Management

#### Session State Structure
```python
session_state = {
    "trials": {},                    # Question attempt data
    "start_time": "ISO timestamp",
    "student_id": "auto-generated",
    "email": "hamilton.edu address",
    "optional_responses": {},        # Optional question answers
    "session_complete": False,
    "completed_sections": set(),     # Section completion status
    "completed_questions": {},       # Question completion status
    "current_section": None,
    "current_question": None
}
```

#### Export System
- **Password Protection**: CSV export requires instructor password
- **Student Data**: One row per student with comprehensive attempt data
- **Privacy**: Only accessible to authorized users

## Section-Specific Logic
