        "It is important to distinguish between the physics problems done in lecture and the situations that arise in this lab. In class, every problem is tailored to be as pristine as possible. Massless, frictionless, perfectly spherical objects often lead to one perfect solution to in class physics problems. The real world, however, is far messier than these problems would lead you to believe.",
        "All measurements, no matter how good, involve some uncertainty in the result.",
        "Error analysis is the study of that uncertainty. Knowledge of the uncertainty in a measurement is crucial for determining the reliability of a measurement.",
        "When reporting experimental results, physicists almost always include estimates of uncertainty, so that others can judge the quality of the results. Sometimes major advances in physics have depended on good error analysis.",
        "For example, it was known 150 years ago that the perihelion of Mercury, or point of closest approach to the sun, precessed very slowly about the sun at a rate of 1.555 degrees per century. Newton's theory of gravity predicted a precession of only 1.544 degrees. While these numbers were close, they did not agree to within the known uncertainties. (If you don’t know the word precession, you can read about it on",

        "A number of proposals were made to explain the discrepancy, but none were satisfactory. Finally, in 1915, Einstein showed that his General Theory of Relativity added 0.012 degrees to the prediction of Newton's theory, thus bringing theory into almost perfect agreement with experiment. This confirmation of Einstein's theory was critical for its acceptance by the scientific community as an improvement over Newton's theory.",

        "As an example, suppose that you ride your bicycle to the Clinton Hannaford a number of times and your bike odometer reads 1.7 miles, 1.8 miles, 1.8 miles, and 1.7 miles. The tenth of a mile variation indicates the precision of the measurement, and the variation might be due to random wiggles in your riding. On the other hand suppose you drive the same distance and you find that your car odometer reads 2.0 miles. The difference indicates a systematic error; one, or both, of the odometers must be measuring the distance incorrectly.",
        "When we repeat an experiment a number of times and examine the variation in the data, we are obtaining information about the random errors in the experiment but we learn nothing about the systematic errors. This is because",

        ". Suppose a stopwatch is designed for operation between 50ºF and 80ºF and when the temperature is above 80º F it runs too fast. If the measurements were made when the temperature was 90ºF, then all of the time readings would be too large. We have no way of knowing about this effect from examining the variation in the data.",
        "Systematic errors can be found (and corrected for) by comparing a result to one known to be more reliable, but often that may not be available, or it may not even exist! Sometimes systematic errors arise because our apparatus is not actually measuring what we think it is measuring. For example, when we measure mass with an electronic balance there is a systematic error due to the fact that air exerts a small upward buoyant force on objects. Detecting systematic errors and estimating the uncertainty in a measurement due to systematic errors is usually very difficult. In this course we will try to be very cognizant of possible systematic errors, but most of our error analysis will pertain to random errors.",

In this case the uncertainty in the measurement is not determined by the precision of the stopwatch, but the circumstances surrounding the measurement.
