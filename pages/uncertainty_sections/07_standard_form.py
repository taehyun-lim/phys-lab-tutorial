        In order to save time and effort, we will often make rather crude estimates of the uncertainty in a measurement. To indicate that our uncertainties are only estimates, we normally report the uncertainty to only 1 significant figure. (Even in very careful scientific work, uncertainties are rarely reported to more than 2 significant figures.)

        For example, suppose that the time for a marble to fall a distance of 1.00 m is measured 6 times and the average is 0.48 s. The standard error is (0.0331 s)/âˆš6 = 0.0135 s â‰ˆ 0.01 s. The result, reported in **standard form** is

        t = (0.48 Â± 0.01) s.
        or
        t = 0.48 Â± 0.01 s.

        Notice that the last digit reported, the 8 in this example, is the digit that is uncertain. Both are reported to the tenths place.

        **Note**: Don't bother counting the number of significant figures for the value. This is a more sophisticated method of error analysis than significant figures.

        **Note**: Do not round too soon! Round only at the very end, after all calculations are complete. Use your calculator.

        **Note** that standard form is not the same thing as scientific notation, but you can combine them if you want. If the result and uncertainty are written in scientific notation, then the uncertainty should be written in scientific notation as well. For example:

        t = (4.8 Ã— 10^-1) Â± (1 Ã— 10^-2) s. Both scientific notation and standard form.

        Standard form does require the formats to match, so this is NOT standard form:

        t = (4.8 Ã— 10^-1) Â± 0.1 s     [NOT standard form]

        because it makes it more difficult for the reader to interpret the measurement as a range of believable values.

        Usually we only use scientific notation when it makes the result more readable, and in scientific publications, metric prefixes are more common than scientific notation.

        **Summary instructions**:
        - Round the uncertainty to 1 significant figure.
        - Round the value to the same decimal place as the uncertainty. Match the format.
        - Write the value and uncertainty together as:    value  Â± uncertainty unit
